This an insurance web project co developed by Chen Dong and Yingli Chen from New York University.
Our application focuses on collecting usersâ€™ information and then applying our machine learning algorithms to analyze it. Then, we adjust our price based on the results of our machine learning algorithms. That is to say, users can interact with our application which shows an End to End architecture. 

# How to run it
1. Install node and npm (latest version should be good enough)
2. Enter the directory insurance_client and run ```npm install``` on terminal to install node_modules.
3. run ```npm start``` to start the frond-end
4. back to root and use ```pip install flask``` to install flask and run ```python run.py``` to start the back-end.

Finally, you should be able to interact with the front-end!

Good luck and have fun!
